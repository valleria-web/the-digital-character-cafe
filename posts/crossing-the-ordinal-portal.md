# Crossing the Ordinal Portal

Since the opening of the ordinal portal in 2022, the Bitcoin population has experienced vertiginous growth. And as a group of brave and determined pioneers, the Sub10k group has been one of the first to inscribe their images on the Bitcoin blockchain.


Each registration is a flag that each of these pioneers has wanted to present to the world after crossing the ordinal portal. The images that have been registered represent a varied range of drawings, from cartoons of animals such as pigs, toads, and monkeys, to images related to Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto.


In the Sub10k group, we also find images of former American presidents, various memes on political and economic topics, beautiful abstract images, copies of famous NFTs such as Punks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, the Bitcoin Wizard, images related to trading, and some unpleasant themes, although fortunately, they are few in number.


The feminine was represented in images of sensual heroines. We also find historical images on the cover of famous magazines, and copies of famous paintings such as the Mona Lisa. Pets, numbers, words, natural landscapes, and some audios have been also inscribed.


Two standout original collections are the Planetary Ordinals and Genesis Ordinal, which were possibly inscribed by the same Casey Rodamor, who also perhaps made registration number 0 with an image of a black and white skull with details reminiscent of Mexico's Day of the Dead festivities. Registration number 9999 is the traditional orange Bitcoin logo.


As a Sub100k inscriber, I feel amazed to see the variety of images that have been inscribed on Bitcoin. Each one is an expression of the person who created it and who wanted to leave it as an indelible mark on the Bitcoin blockchain. While observing the Sub10k inscriptions, I have been carefully considering the image that I myself wanted to inscribe forever on Bitcoin.


I am excited by the idea of leaving a message forever in Bitcoin, something representative of me and my mission. In the next article, I will share my inscription and its meaning.
