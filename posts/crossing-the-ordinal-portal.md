# Crossing the Ordinal Portal

No one knew exactly when the Ordinal portal would open, but when we finally received confirmation that the moment had arrived, it was a race to the CLI to execute the command. The excitement in the air was palpable as we watched the number of registrations skyrocket, confirming that the portal was open and that there was life on the other side.


As the number of registrations neared 10 thousand, I couldn't resist the urge any longer. I wanted to be part of the first group to cross into the unknown, but alas, I was only able to join the second group of sub100k. Still, I felt proud to be among the pioneers venturing into the promised land.


From there and from here, I will document this momentous occasion in the history of Bitcoin. Who knows what awaits us on the other side? But one thing is certain: we are part of a revolution, a journey into the unknown that will be remembered for generations to come.
